Hello! I am Gaius <i class="em em-octopus"></i>, the creator of the Pilak Shared Universe, as well as the author of the Freshmen Web Series and the developer of the Pilak Mobile Game.

Currently, this universe is still in its infancy. The rules for its magic system is already in place, even if it is still untested, and the location for the web series has already taken shape. The mobile game's engine is also in place, as well as a rough draft for its gameplay. There's also quite a bit of worldbuilding that I need to take care of.

The most important things that are still missing though, are most of the characters, as well as an overarching storyline for both the serial and the game- I'm still working on those. Don't get me wrong: I know what Freshmen will be all about. I just have to iron out most of the details.

I will update again in a few weeks; in the meantime, I will commit on this: The web serial starts on November 1, just in time with this year's NaNoWriMo. See you then.
